# rotmg-client
Realm of the Mad God AS3 client based on the latest version.

The original client was decompiled in Action Script Viewer and I am continuing to update it manually by looking at the differences in client updates. You can see the changes for yourself in my client-diff repo.

Help with bugs is always helpful. If you found one, make an issue. If you have a fix for one make a pull request.
